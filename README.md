Local storage implementation of a Rt 106 datastore.  This is a simple datastore using a directory structure on the filesystem to manage data. This datastore is geared for small, simple deployments. It provides a simple mechanism to wrap or ingest pre-existing data into Rt 106.  The rt106-datastore REST API is used to serve the data to applications and algorithms.

### Local filesystem organization

rt106-datastore-local prescribes a folder structure for data to manage primary (source) data as well as derived data from algorithm executions.

ID's may be DICOM UIDs (Study Instance UID) or can be UUIDs.

### Docker container

To build the docker container for the front-end:

    $ docker build -t rt106/rt106-datastore-local:latest .

If you use HTTP proxies in your environment, you may need to build using

    $ docker build -t rt106/rt106-datastore-local:latest  --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy  --build-arg no_proxy=$no_proxy .

### Example radiology data

A sample of the data from the [Visible Human Project](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html) can be downloaded and arranged as a local datastore by passing the environment variable ```DOWNLOAD_RAD_DEMO_DATA='on'``` or ```DOWNLOAD_RAD_DEMO_DATA='force'``` to the rt106-datastore-local container on startup.

(DICOM files for Visible Human Project data are downloaded from [https://mri.radiology.uiowa.edu/VHDicom](https://mri.radiology.uiowa.edu/VHDicom).)
